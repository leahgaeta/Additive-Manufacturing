# Additive Manufacturing
The following are lecture notes and lab materials from my Additive Manufacturing course taught by Professor Anna Thornton at Boston University.* Note that this is an ongoing course and the readme will be updated as the class progresses through the fall semester. The goal is to have notes & study guides added weekly.

\* *Lecture slides are not included as those are private to the class, but these notes encompass items learned from lecture, lab, and the various readings completed. In addition, most images are not my own; these were included to help visually aid my understanding of the material.*
